```
**Weaviate** is an open-source vector database.
A vector in this context is just a series of numbers - like [1, 0] or [0.513, 0.155, 0.983, ..., 0.001, 0.932].
Vectors like these are used to capture meaning as a series of numbers.
Each vector representation of such "meaning" is called a vector embedding.
Weaviate does two things that traditional databases do not. They are:
1. Quantifying similarity, and
2. Indexing vector data

. Weaviate uses two API types - REST - for  CRUD , and GraphQL - for searches.
.
